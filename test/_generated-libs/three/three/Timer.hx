/**
	This class is an alternative to
	{@link
	THREE.Clock
	}
	with a different API design and behavior
	The goal is to avoid the conceptual flaws that became apparent in
	{@link
	THREE.Clock
	}
	over time.
	
	-
	{@link
	Timer
	}
	has an
	{@link
	.update()
	}
	method that updates its internal state. That makes it possible to call
	{@link
	.getDelta()
	}
	and
	{@link
	.getElapsed()
	}
	multiple times per simulation step without getting different values.
	- The class can make use of the Page Visibility API to avoid large time delta values when the app is inactive (e.g.
	  tab switched or browser hidden).
