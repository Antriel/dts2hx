/**
	A group of objects that receives a shared animation state.
	
	Usage:
	
	- Add objects you would otherwise pass as 'root' to the
	constructor or the .clipAction method of AnimationMixer.
	- Instead pass this object as 'root'.
	- You can also add and remove objects later when the mixer is running.
	
	Note:
	
	- Objects of this class appear as one object to the mixer,
	so cache control of the individual objects must be done on the group.
	
	Limitation:
	
	- The animated properties must be compatible among the all objects in the group.
	- A single property can either be controlled through a target group or directly, but not both.
