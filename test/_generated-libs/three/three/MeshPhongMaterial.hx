/**
	A material for shiny surfaces with specular highlights.
	
	The material uses a non-physically based [Blinn-Phong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn-Phong_shading_model)
	model for calculating reflectance. Unlike the Lambertian model used in the
	{@link
	MeshLambertMaterial
	}
	this can simulate shiny surfaces with specular
	highlights (such as varnished wood). `MeshPhongMaterial` uses per-fragment shading.
	
	Performance will generally be greater when using this material over the
	{@link
	MeshStandardMaterial
	}
	or
	{@link
	MeshPhysicalMaterial
	}
	, at the cost of
	some graphical accuracy.
